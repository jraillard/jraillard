I'm sharing knowledges about technologies I used or just heard about :smiley:.

As a member of [Tech'Vox Speakers](https://techvox.lepodcast.fr/), our podcast will cover as much news about IT as we can :grin:

## Fun fact about me

You may have notice that my Github profile picture is a [Squirtle](https://www.pokepedia.fr/Carapuce). :eyes:

As I was a student, he used to be my favorite pokemon starter.

Therefore I took the decision to make it my profile picture in almost all tech-relative accounts I have, and then update it as [Wartortle](https://www.pokepedia.fr/Carabaffe) and [Blastoise](https://www.pokepedia.fr/Tortank) as I would progress in my developper career.

Funny right ? :grin:
